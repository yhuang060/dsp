[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Exercise 4   Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
(7.201094430437772, 7.325855614973262)

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
-0.088672927072602

The cohen effect size of total weight_lb between first babies and others is -0.0887 which is small effect size.
The difference is trivial.
