[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> Exercise 7.1 Using data from the NSFG, make a scatter plot of birth weight versus mother’s age. Plot percentiles of birth weight versus mother’s age. Compute Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations. How would you character- ize the relationship between these variables?
Solution

    import first

    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    live = live.dropna(subset=['agepreg', 'totalwgt_lb'])
    
    ages = live.agepreg
    weights = live.totalwgt_lb
    print('Corr', Corr(ages, weights)) #Corr 0.06883397035410908
    print('SpearmanCorr', SpearmanCorr(ages, weights))#SpearmanCorr 0.09461004109658226

    # 1) The scatterplot shows a weak relationship between the variables, age & weight, but
    #    it is hard to see clearly.

    # 2) The correlations support this.  Pearson's is around 0.07, Spearman's
    #    is around 0.09.  The difference between them suggests some influence
    #    of outliers or a non-linear relationsip.

    # 3) Plotting percentiles of weight versus age suggests that the
    #    relationship is non-linear.  Birth weight increases more quickly
    #    in the range of mother's age from 15 to 25.  After that, the effect
    #    is weaker.
